# BASIC INTRO ABOUT THE PROJECT
The primary purpose of making the cinema ticket booking system is to create an 
automatic online based system which will provide an easy and an alternate way to book 
a ticket for a movie. The customer will need to enter the information related to film after 
which the system will provide options to book the ticket. In this Online cinema ticket 
booking system, the staff of the cinema hall won’t have to do anything for the ticket 
booking as the process will be done by the customer through the web which will reduce 
the number of staff required in the booking counter

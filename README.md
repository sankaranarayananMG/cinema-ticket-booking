#Here are basic information about the cinema-ticket-booking
A Theatre Booking System is a project that allows users to check for available 
seats in the theatre and can book them at the same time. It happens when people go 
for a movie and they return in disappointment due to houseful. Hence the project is 
intended to overcome this situation by automating the manual booking system, online.
Users can make prior bookings for desired seats for their desired show at desired time
and cost. The system provides additional optional things like food packages, discounts
etc. It also calculates all the associated charges incurred in booking the ticket and the 
items. This is an advanced booking system that makes user customize their show 
according to their needs
